# Recommender System Project

This project explores different recommender system algorithms using the MovieLens 100k dataset. Focus is on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method.

- `SVD.py`: Implements the SVD algorithm and outputs its performance metrics.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-surprise`, and others typically used for data processing and machine learning tasks.

### Prerequisites

Install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-surprise


Install all required dependencies using pip:
```


### Running the Scripts

1. **SVD Algorithm Output**
   - To see the output of the SVD algorithm, run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python SVD.py
   ```



## Additional Information

- Ensure that the dataset is correctly placed in the expected directory if the scripts require loading external data.
- Adjust the script parameters or dataset path as needed to fit your specific setup.
